This is because a bite from a driver ant hurts a whole lot. Once a driver ant has punctured your skin with its large jaws, it can take a long time before you are able to detach the ant from your skin.</P>

        <P class="dtails">When snapping their jaw shut, trap-jaw ants reach speeds up to 145 mph, exerting forces 300 to 500 times the ant's body weight! However, these ants also have a painful stinger, and if a nest is threatened, workers will immediately jump at the attacker, stinging and biting.</P>

    <h1>Hello! I am Raven P. Dejecacion</h1>
    <p>Currently living in Pikit, North Cotabato, Born on March 8, 2004. A freshmen student at the University of Southern Mindanao, And pursuing BS in Information Systems course because I like both business and programming. Starting an exciting new chapter in my educational journey.</p>

    <p>In my studies, I’m learning into the field of Information Systems, especially focusing particularly on the business and programming. It’s been a true eye-opener, teaching me a ton of business clever and coding skills. Being the first billionaire in my family is my big dream.  It’s a goal that motivates me to continue with my studies, not just about the money.</p>

    <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing online games, exploring on to the world of programmming, and learning new things.</p>

    <p>Looking ahead, my dreams is to become a programmer. I’m not just aiming to be a good coder, I want to be a leader who can navigate the tricky intersection of business strategy and code complexity with ease.  A life full of prosperity and success, where my ability for programming is more than just a talent but rather a vital component of a successful business career.</p>
